# QuickPark â€” Valet SaaS (MERN)

This repository contains a production-minded MVP of QuickPark: a multi-location valet SaaS with Paid/Free business models, location-scoped public pages, a valet dashboard, WhatsApp notifications (Twilio sandbox), real-time updates (Socket.IO), and payments (Razorpay test integration). The frontend is built with React + Vite; backend is Node/Express + MongoDB Atlas.
